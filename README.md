# color-describe
Experimentation with novel models that can generate color descriptions. The experimental setup had the following game 
played:

1. Person 1 is shown 3 color patches, out of which 1 is highlighted.
2. He has to write a position/order-invariant description to identify the color.
3. Person 2 reads the description and tries to identify the color from the above list (but this time jumbled).

This work tries to build a novel model that can text-describe the colors based on context.

The ideas developed here are based on Monroe et. al. (2016 & 2017) & Prof. Chris Potts' guidance.
